# Mini Todo App

This is a simple and interactive todo app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, delete, mark tasks as complete, and reorder them by dragging and dropping. It also saves todos to `localStorage`, so the list persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add new todos to the list.
- **Delete Todo**: Todos can be deleted by clicking the delete button.
- **Mark Complete**: Users can mark todos as complete with a checkbox.
- **Drag and Drop**: Todos can be reordered by dragging and dropping them.
- **Persistent Storage**: Todos are saved in the browser's localStorage and persist across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structured the content and elements for the Todo App.
- **CSS**: Styled the app, including the todo list, buttons, and checkboxes.
- **JavaScript**: Handles adding, deleting, marking complete, and drag-and-drop reordering of todos.
- **localStorage**: Stores todos in the browser to persist data.

## Setup

1. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the app.
